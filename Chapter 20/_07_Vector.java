// A Vector in Java is a part of the java.util package and is one of the legacy classes in Java that implements the List interface.
// It was introduced in JDK 1.0 before collection framework and is synchronized, making it thread-safe. Now it is a part of collection framework.
// However, due to its synchronization overhead, it's generally recommended to use other modern alternatives like ArrayList in single-threaded scenarios.
// Despite this, Vector is still useful in certain situations, particularly in multi-threaded environments where thread safety is a concern.
// Key Features of Vector
// Dynamic Array: Like ArrayList, Vector is a dynamic array that grows automatically when more elements are added than its current capacity.
// Synchronized: All the methods in Vector are synchronized, which makes it thread-safe This means multiple threads can work on a Vector without the risk of corrupting the data. However, this can introduce performance overhead in single-threaded environments.
// Legacy Class: Vector was part of Java's original release and is considered a legacy class. It's generally recommended to use ArrayList in single-threaded environments due to performance considerations.
// Resizing Mechanism: When the current capacity of the vector is exceeded, it doubles its size by default (or increases by a specific capacity increment if provided). Similar to arrays and ArrayList,Vector allows random access toâ€”elements, making it efficient for accessing elements using an index.
// if the initial capacity is given to the vector, then if it exceeds the capacity then it doubles the capacity.
// eg. initial capacity = 5, then new capacity = initial capacity * 2 = 10;

// vector is thread Safe.


class _07_Vector {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vector<Integer> v = new Vector<>(5, 3); // initial capacity = 5, it will increase by 3 i.e 8.
        v.add(23);
        v.add(10);
        v.add(38);
        v.add(83);
        v.add(68);
        System.out.println(v.capacity()); //5
        v.add(45);
        v.add(45);
        v.add(45);
        System.out.println(v.capacity()); //8
        v.add(45);
        System.out.println(v.capacity()); //11

        LinkedList<Integer> LinkedList = new LinkedList<>();
        LinkedList.add(34);
        LinkedList.add(90);
        LinkedList.add(76);
        LinkedList.add(87);
        LinkedList.add(19);

        // asList
        Vector<Integer> v1 = new Vector<>(LinkedList);
        System.out.println(LinkedList);

        // Methods
        // add(E e): Adds an element at the end.
        // add(int index, E element): Inserts an element at the specified index.
        // get(int index): Retrieves the element at the specified index.
        // set(int index, E element): Replaces the element at the specified index.
        // remove(Object o): Removes the first occurrence of the specified element.
        // remove(int index): Removes the element at the specified index.
        // Returns the number of elements in the vector.
        // size():
        // isEmpty():
        // Checks if the vector is empty.
        // contains(Object o): Checks if the vector contains the specified element.
        // Removes all elements from the vector.
        // clear():


        // Internal Implementation of Vector
        // Internally, Vector uses an array to store its elements.The size of this array grows as needed when more elements are added. The default behavior is to double
        // the size of the array when it runs out of space. This resizing operation is a costly one, as it requires copying the old elements to the new, larger array.

        // Synchronization and Performance
        // Since Vector methods are synchronized, it ensures that only one thread can access the vector at a time. This makes it thread-safe
        // but can introduce performance overhead in single-threaded environments because synchronization adds locking and unlocking costs.
        // In modern Java applications, ArrayList is generally preferred over Vector when synchronization isn't required. For thread-safe
        // collections, the CopyOnWriteArrayList or ConcurrentHashMap from the java.util.concurrent package is often recommended instead.

        // 1. Vector is a legacy synchronized collection class that
        // implements the List interface.
        // 2. It behaves like a dynamic array and grows as needed.
        // 3. It provides thread safety but with a performance cost in single-threaded environments.
        // 4. In modern applications, ArrayList or concurrent alternatives like CopyOnWriteArrayList are typically preferred over Vector unless thread safety is a priority.
