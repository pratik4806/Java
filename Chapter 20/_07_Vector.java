import java.util.Vector;

// A Vector in Java is a part of the java.util package and is one of the legacy classes in Java that implements the List interface.
// It was introduced in JDK 1.0 before collection framework and is synchronized, making it thread-safe. Now it is a part of collection framework.
// However, due to its synchronization overhead, it's generally recommended to use other modern alternatives like ArrayList in single-threaded scenarios.
// Despite this, Vector is still useful in certain situations, particularly in multi-threaded environments where thread safety is a concern.


// Key Features of Vector
// Dynamic Array: Like ArrayList, Vector is a dynamic array that grows automatically when more elements are added than its current capacity.

// Synchronized: All the methods in Vector are synchronized, which makes it thread-safe This means multiple threads can work on a Vector without the risk of corrupting the data. However, this can introduce performance overhead in single-threaded environments.

// Legacy Class: Vector was part of Java's original release and is considered a legacy class. It's generally recommended to use ArrayList in single-threaded environments due to performance considerations.

// Resizing Mechanism: When the current capacity of the vector is exceeded, it doubles its size by default (or increases by a specific capacity increment if provided). Similar to arrays and ArrayList,Vector allows random access toâ€”elements, making it efficient for accessing elements using an index.

// if the initial capacity is given to the vector, then if it exceeds the capacity then it doubles the capacity.
// eg. initial capacity = 5, then new capacity = initial capacity * 2 = 10;
